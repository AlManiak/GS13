In the short breaks when I'm not observed, I'm trying to fix this radio I managed to sneak by... but judging by how I can barely squeeze my ass past this stupid hole less and less each day, I might not fix it in time..."

	info = "The woman seems to be showing great progress, we'll be moving her into the larger cell soon. The lizard guy is still a bit reluctant about eating himself into immobility... but no matter, we'll just double his portions. Perhaps a painfully overstuffed stomach will change his mind."

I've suggested that it's just fauna, but they insist that it's unlike anything they've ever seen before... and yet they can never describe those things.

				<h3>Drinks for Growing Guts</h3>

				Been a bartender for Gato quite a while now. In my time here, I've taken notice of how certain mixes produced...
				Certain effects, that the same mixtures don't produce elsewhere. I'm writing down my findings here.

				<ol>
				<li>Belly Bloats: equal parts gibb floats and beer. Really bulks up a belly. Some folks got real bloated with air after drinking this one.</li>
				<li>Blobby Mary: equal parts tomato juice, vodka and lipoifier. If you want to get back at some rich folks, this is your drink.</li>
				<li>Heavy Cafe: equal parts latte, either cafe or soy, sugar and cream. One hell of a bomb to start a shift with.</li>
				<li>Fruits Tea: equal parts berry juice, lemon juice and tea. Even teetotal folks aren't safe from growing. Some folks become... Real sloshy. Note: I once mixed it with blueberry juice from a vendor. Be ready to juice if you do too.</li>
				<li>Snakebite: equal parts toxins, lime juice and lipoifier. Feels like a snake biting your throat when it goes down. Sure "paralyzes" like some real snake bites.</li>
				<li>Beltbuster Mead: equal parts mead, ethanol, cream and lipoifier. Very alcoholic and immensely fattening. Clothes won't hold after this one.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				Remember, this stuff is quite something. Don't serve these to folks that don't want it.
